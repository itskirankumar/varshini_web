/**
 * A cinematic beat between two content sections.
 *
 * Transparent, so the WebGL frame behind it is the only thing on screen, and
 * tall enough that the shot gets held rather than glimpsed. These beats are
 * what give the page its spacing: copy never has to compete with a moving
 * photograph, because the photograph gets the frame to itself first and the
 * opaque content surface then slides cleanly over it.
